#Predicting Numbers Using Logistic Regression
- Logistic Regression is a regression algorithm used to solve classificatin problems
- We used load_digits as our datasets
- We have 1797 Response Vector(y) , 1797 rows with 64 columns as our Feature Matrix(X)
- We used Train_Test_Split as our model_evaluation procedure
- We also used Cross_Validation for better estimation
- we used Classification_accuracy as our model_evaluation metrics
- We used confusion matrix inorder to understand our classification metrics well , in which the diagonal numbers showed us the correct prediction.
